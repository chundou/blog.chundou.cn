## Setup environment

First of first, make sure you had completed install docker & docker-compose on your machine.
To check this, you can use these two commands:

```shell script
> docker info
> docker-compsoe version
```

Start up the environment is easy than you think! Here are the commands:

```shell script
> cd docker # go to the right folder (./docker)
> docker-compose up  # start up all the environment
```
